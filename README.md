# NBA_GAME_PREDICTION
The purpose of this project is to predict the winning team of an NBA game based
on the match statistics of the home team. The home team is the team with the
land factor since it plays in the home stadium with many fans. Instead the away
team often comes from afar and is supported by few fans during the game. The
input variables are samples composed of different game statistics: ranking, field
goal percentage (FGP), field goal three point percentage (FG3P), free throws made
(FTM), rebounds (REB), assists (AST), steals (STL) and the blocks (BLK). The
output is a binary result {YES, NO} that specifies if the home team wins or not
